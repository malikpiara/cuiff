# Fuzzboard

Daily standup meetings can be a pain in remote settings due to time zone differences. When people miss out, they can feel disconnected. On the other hand, Slack bot alternatives can make standups feel like a chore where people have to report what they are working on.

Fuzzboard provides teams with a long-form writing alternative to daily standups. The goal of this product is to improve autonomy and communication while boosting motivation by letting everyone see daily progress.
