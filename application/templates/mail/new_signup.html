<p>Howdy {{ user_name }}, welcome to Fuzzboard!</p>
<p>I believe that teams that operate with autonomy and open communication as guiding principles become world-class early on. Fuzzboard provides teams with a long-form writing alternative to daily standups. It was built for people who prefer to work remotely. </p>
<p>The app hasn't been released yet. Please, don't expect things to work properly!</p>
<p>Best wishes,</p>
